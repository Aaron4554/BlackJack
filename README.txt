This is a Simple command-line BlackJake game. You finish your hand before the dealer gets delt. When you get delt an ace you have the option of having it played as either a 1 or 11, until you bust, at which point the ace will revert to a 1 and you can contnue with your new handsize. The dealer deals to them selves until they hit the limit of 17. If they get delt an ace they will choose to use it as a 11 if it wont cause them to bust. try your best!

Working to add:
